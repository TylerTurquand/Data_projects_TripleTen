##Overview

The project entails a comprehensive analysis of the superstore's operational performance across three key dimensions.

In Part 1, the focus is on identifying profit and loss centers by analyzing various pairs of dimensions, like region and category. Visualizations are utilized to justify conclusions and determine products and product subcategories that should be discontinued or emphasized. 
Part 2 delves into assessing the viability of advertising by identifying optimal state-month combinations for maximum return on ad spend. 
Part 3 involves analyzing return rates of products and customers to determine potential anomalies and their impact on profitability. Visualizations are employed to provide insights into the relationship between average profit and return rates, aiding in strategic decision-making for the superstore.

##Results
###Part 1 
The two biggest loss centers were found in the southern region of the United States: Furniture and Office Supplies. Furniture, specifically tables and bookcases caused the biggest losses in general.
The two biggest profit centers were found in the Western Region: Office Supplies and Technology. Technology, like copiers, phones, and their accessories brought the most positive revenue.
It was advised to stop selling any items with a loss of $1,000 or more as an intital change to store inventory. A stronger focus on techonlogy items was suggested as well.

###Part 2
The top three states to focus advertisement on were determined by highest generated revenue for each state and month, and are as follows:
Indiana - Best Month: October, maximum ad spend: $128.63
Rhode Island - Best Month: December, maximum ad spend: $50.00
Vermont - Best Month: November, maximum ad spend: $119.19

###Part 3
Return rates were found for individual products and customers. However, after further analysis, it was shown that there wasn't a big correlation between average return rates and average revenue per category.
